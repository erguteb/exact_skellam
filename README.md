# exact_skellam

An exact sampler for generating Skellam random variates. 
The algorithm is based on https://www.combinatorics.org/ojs/index.php/eljc/article/view/v23i4p22/pdf
The implementation is based on https://github.com/peteroupc/peteroupc.github.io/blob/master/randomfunc.md#Poisson_Distribution
We adopt the convention that randomint() is the only accessible randomness.
